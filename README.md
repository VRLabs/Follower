## How it works

* Using a [Damping Constraint](https://github.com/VRLabs/Damping-Constraints) inside of a [World Constraint](https://github.com/VRLabs/World-Constraint) we can make an object slowly follow the player.
* By using Contact Senders and Contact Receivers we can dynamically change the speed of the follower over time.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/Follower/assets/76777936/eee1dcbb-0e9d-4f92-bb69-9bcbe50d9948

* Merge the Animator Controller ``Follower FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & Drop the ``Follower`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Follower Target``.
* Move ``Follower Target`` outside of ``Follower`` and place it anywhere in your avatars hierarchy as needed.

## How to use

* Place the objects you want to follow you inside ``Container``.
  * Alternatively you can constrain the objects to ``Container``.
* Editing the ``Follow`` animation clip will let you change the speed of the follower.

## Performance stats

```c++
Constraints:        5
Contact Receivers:  1
Contact Senders:    1
```

## Hierarchy layout
